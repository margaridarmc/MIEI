IT IS NOT TOO MUCH TO REQUIRE THAT WHAT THE WISEST OF MANKIND, THOSEEWHO ARE BEST ENTITLED TO TRUST THEIR OWN JUDGMENT, FIND NECESSARY TOEWARRANT THEIR RELYING ON IT, SHOULD BE SUBMITTED TO BY THATEMISCELLANEOUS COLLECTION OF A FEW WISE AND MANY FOOLISH INDIVIDUALS,ECALLED THE PUBLIC. THE MOST INTOLERANT OF CHURCHES, THE ROMAN CATHOLICECHURCH, EVEN AT THE CANONISATION OF A SAINT, ADMITS, AND LISTENSEPATIENTLY TO, A "DEVIL'S ADVOCATE." THE HOLIEST OF MEN, IT APPEARS,ECANNOT BE ADMITTED TO POSTHUMOUS HONOURS, UNTIL ALL THAT THE DEVILECOULD SAY AGAINST HIM IS KNOWN AND WEIGHED. IF EVEN THE NEWTONIANEPHILOSOPHY WERE NOT PERMITTED TO BE QUESTIONED, MANKIND COULD NOT FEELEAS COMPLETE ASSURANCE OF ITS TRUTH AS THEY NOW DO. THE BELIEFS WHICHEWE HAVE MOST WARRANT FOR, HAVE NO SAFEGUARD TO REST ON, BUT A STANDINGEINVITATION TO THE WHOLE WORLD TO PROVE THEM UNFOUNDED. IF THEECHALLENGE IS NOT ACCEPTED, OR IS ACCEPTED AND THE ATTEMPT FAILS, WEEARE FAR ENOUGH FROM CERTAINTY STILL; BUT WE HAVE DONE THE BEST THATETHE EXISTING STATE OF HUMAN REASON ADMITS OF; WE HAVE NEGLECTEDENOTHING THAT COULD GIVE THE TRUTH A CHANCE OF REACHING US: IF THEELISTS ARE KEPT OPEN, WE MAY HOPE THAT IF THERE BE A BETTER TRUTH, ITEWILL BE FOUND WHEN THE HUMAN MIND IS CAPABLE OF RECEIVING IT; AND INETHE MEANTIME WE MAY RELY ON HAVING ATTAINED SUCH APPROACH TO TRUTH, ASEIS POSSIBLE IN OUR OWN DAY. THIS IS THE AMOUNT OF CERTAINTY ATTAINABLEEBY A FALLIBLE BEING, AND THIS THE SOLE WAY OF ATTAINING IT.
